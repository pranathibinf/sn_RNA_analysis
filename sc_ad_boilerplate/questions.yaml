task: >
  You have been given single-nucleus RNA-seq data from human brain tissue
  comparing Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases to control samples (subset of PRJNA975472 / GSE233208).
  Using the provided pipeline outputs, answer the following objective questions.

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: counting
    text: "How many cells are retained in the merged dataset after filtering?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: counting
    text: "Which sample has the highest number of cells after filtering?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: quantification
    text: "Which gene has the highest total UMI count in SRR24710556?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: clustering_markers
    text: "List the top 3 marker genes for cluster 0 in order of adjusted p-value."
    answer_type: ordered_list

  - id: q5
    stage: sparsity
    text: "How many genes have all-zero counts in SRR24710556 in counts_unfiltered?"
    answer_type: integer_exact
